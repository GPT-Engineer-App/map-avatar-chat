# map-avatar-chat

Navbar with a toggleable sidebar on the left. On the right is a collapsible chat window. In the center will be a map, for now can be blank or placeholder. But we do need implementations of: user avatars being displayed on locations throughout the 'map' or map placeholder, x,y,z scrolling around map area, when user avatar is clicked open chat window.
